    <h1>Constant acceleration</h1>
    <p title= "Prvi paragraf">
      In many types of motion, the acceleration is either constant or approximately so.
      For example, you might accelerate a car at an approximately constant rate when
      a traffic light turns from red to green. Then graphs of your position, velocity,
      and acceleration would resemble those in Fig. 2.4.1. (Note that a(t) in
      Fig. 2.4.1c is constant, which requires that v(t) in Fig. 2.4.1b have a constant
      slope.) Later when you brake the car to a stop, the acceleration (or deceleration
      in common language) might also be approximately constant.
      Such cases are so common that a special set of equations has been
      derived for dealing with them. One approach to the derivation of these equations
      is given in this section. A second approach is given in the next section.
      Throughout both sections and later when you work on the homework
      problems, keep in mind <i> that these equations are valid only for constant acceleration
      (or situations in which you can approximate the acceleration as being
      constant)</i>. <br> <strong>First Basic Equation.</strong> When the acceleration is constant, 
      the average acceleration and instantaneous acceleration are equal and we can write
      Eq. 2.3.1, with some changes in notation, as <br> <i>a = v<sub>0</sub> + at</i>.

      <strong>Second Basic Equation.</strong> In a similar manner, we can rewrite Eq. 2.1.2 (with a 
      few changes in notation) as <br> <i>x - x<sub>0</sub> = v<sub>0</sub>t + at<sup>2</sup>/2</i>
      <br>As a check, note that putting t = 0 yields x = x 0 , as it must. As a further check,
      taking the derivative of Eq. 2.4.5 yields Eq. 2.4.1, again as it must. Figure 2.4.1a
      shows a plot of Eq. 2.4.5; the function is quadratic and thus the plot is curved.
